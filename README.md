# data_analysis
Data analysis of chemical dynamics simulations using Fortran routines and Unix/bash scripts.
This repository contains the scripts I have developed over the years to analyze text based output files of chemical direct dynamics 
simulations of biomolecules. Most of these scripts are very specific to the output files I was dealing with. I perform data analysis 
using Python now and did not have time to generalize these scripts. If you need more information or help in using any of these
scripts, please feel free to contact me.
